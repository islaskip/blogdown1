<p>It’s been two weeks since I started to learn to use R and it has been a huge challenge since I don’t really have a background in terms of programming. To learn I’ve done a few courses over edX and I’ve followed some youtube tutorials but I haven’t really done any project of my own… until now!</p>
<p>It’s been two weeks since I started to learn to use R and it has been a huge challenge since I don’t really have a background in terms of programming.

Yesterday night I happened to find <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/imbenab/community-episodes-imdb-ratings">Isabella’s dataset</a> of the IMDb ratings of the popular show Community. I downloaded it just for fun and I discovered that it was an easy, ready-to-use dataset.<br />
4 hours later I realized my knowledge of R is really basic and even simple tasks like plotting clean datasets are a true challenge. However, even if it took me a little more time than I expected, I managed to plot the following Violin Plot of the Community’s rating over each season highlighting a few episodes which had incredible high (or low) ratings:</p>

<div id="things-i-noticed" class="section level3">
<h3>Things I noticed:</h3>
<p>Last month I rewatched the whole show so I had a few thought that got confirmed by the data:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first three seasons had the best reception and season 4 had the lowest ratings. The absence of Dan Harmon was noticeable.<br />
</li>
<li>Modern Warfare was the best-rated episode (my favorite in fact).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="things-i-learned" class="section level3">
<h3>Things I learned:</h3>
<ul>
<li>To make violin plots and to label outliers.<br />
</li>
<li>To use Blogdown to publish this.</li>
</ul>

<div id="things-i-struggled-with-and-ill-try-to-learn-in-the-following-days" class="section level3">
<h3>Things I struggled with and I’ll try to learn in the following days:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Exporting high-quality plots.</li>
<li>The use of different fonts in ggplot.<br />
</li>
<li>Facet density plots.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s it! Pretty simple but I’m happy with it being my first mini-project.<br />
I’ll try to keep posting and I’ll probably join the TidyTuesday challenge to keep improving my R knowledge.</p>
