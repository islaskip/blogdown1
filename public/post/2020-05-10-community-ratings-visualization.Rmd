It's been two weeks since I started to learn to use R and it has been a huge challenge since I don't really have a background in terms of programming. To learn I've done a few courses over edX and I've followed some youtube tutorials but I haven't really done any project of my own... until now!

It's been two weeks since I started to learn to use R and it has been a huge challenge since I don't really have a background in terms of programming. To learn I've done a few courses over edX and I've followed some youtube tutorials but I haven't really done any project of my own... until now!  
Yesterday night I happened to find [Isabella's dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/imbenab/community-episodes-imdb-ratings) of the IMDb ratings of the popular show Community. I downloaded it just for fun and I discovered that it was an easy, ready-to-use dataset.  
4 hours later I realized my knowledge of R is really basic and even simple tasks like plotting clean datasets are a true challenge. However, even if it took me a little more time than I expected, I managed to plot the following Violin Plot of the Community's rating over each season highlighting a few episodes which had incredible high (or low) ratings:

### Things I noticed:  
Last month I rewatched the whole show so I had a few thought that got confirmed by the data:  
* The first three seasons had the best reception and season 4 had the lowest ratings. The absence of Dan Harmon was noticeable.  
* Modern Warfare was the best-rated episode (my favorite in fact).  

### Things I learned:  
* To make violin plots and to label outliers.  
* To use Blogdown to publish this.  

### Things I struggled with and I'll try to learn in the following days:  
* Exporting high-quality plots. 
* The use of different fonts in ggplot.  
* Facet density plots.  

That's it! Pretty simple but I'm happy with it being my first mini-project.    
I'll try to keep posting and I'll probably join the TidyTuesday challenge to keep improving my R knowledge.
